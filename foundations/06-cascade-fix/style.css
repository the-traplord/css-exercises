.para {
  font-size: 22px;

.small-para {

/* 
 refering to lines 11 to 18, the original
 order was as below:

  .small-para {
    font-size: 14px;
    font-weight: 800;
  }

  .para {
    font-size: 22px;
  }

The issue was that since the following 
line had 2 class selectors, CSS took the order of the 
class selectors and applied the second one to the below line

<p class="para small-para">I'm a smaller paragraph, also with extra bold text!</p>

the result was that the font size of 22px was applied, instead of 14px

/* 

for .confirm and .button, the order was as follows


  .confirm {
  background: green;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
            }

  .button {
  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);

  border-color: black;

          }
  
  .button toop preference over .confirm
  and therefore no green was applied to
  the confirm background. Switching order
  made the result align to desired-outcome.png

/* 

originally .child was before .text, so 
added .child after .text so 
text does not override .child

then added div to make div.child so that it
would be able to be selected. 

WIth this in place, applying the .chile only comes
down to rule order, with the last one
winning in getting applied
